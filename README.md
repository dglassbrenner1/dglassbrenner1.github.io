# Donna Glassbrenner, Ph.D. - Data Science & Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website (`dglassbrenner1.github.io`), showcasing my work in fraud detection, customized data analysis, and vehicle safety/risk analytics.

---

## 🌐 What This Portfolio Shows

The live site is designed for hiring managers, recruiters, and collaborators interested in:

- **Fraud Detection Projects** – Self-initiated R&D using synthetic and public datasets to explore fraud detection, combining machine learning with advanced statistics.
- **Customized Data Analyses** – Illustrative examples of non-standard, complex analytical problems (ratios, rare events, reporting lags, ambiguous objectives) where cookie-cutter or “Stats 101/AI” approaches can fail, and how custom statistical methods address them.
- **Vehicle Safety Work** – Selected published reports and papers from my vehicle safety and risk analysis career, including modeling, sample design, and impact estimation.
- **About & Contact** – My background, focus areas, and how to reach me for fully remote, no-travel roles in fraud detection, educational technology, or health and safety.

For a more narrative overview of my skills and experience, see the About section on the live site.

I am seeking fully remote roles (no travel) in fraud detection, social impact (education, health, safety), product testing, or manufacturing (avoiding marketing/sales roles). Open to W2 or 1099, full-time or part-time (20-40 hrs/week).
