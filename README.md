# Donna Glassbrenner Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, published at  
[https://glassbrenner1.github.io/](https://glassbrenner1.github.io/).

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. mathematician, turned statistician, turned data scientist. I have a particular affinity for applications that drive impactful decisions, like in fraud detection. This portfolio highlights my projects, technical writing, and demonstrations.
