# Donna Glassbrenner, Ph.D. - Data Science Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website (`dglassbrenner1.github.io`), showcasing analytical work spanning fraud detection, customized statistical methods, and vehicle safety research.

---

## 🌐 What This Portfolio Shows

The live site demonstrates my analytical capabilities through:

- **Fraud Detection Projects** – Self-initiated R&D combining machine learning with advanced statistical methods. Projects demonstrate production-oriented thinking (48% cost reduction optimizing for business value) and custom statistical approaches (30% accuracy improvements) using synthetic and public datasets.

- **Customized Data Analyses** – Examples of complex analytical problems where standard approaches fall short: handling ratios, rare events, reporting lags, and ambiguous requirements. Shows how custom statistical methods solve problems that cookie-cutter approaches miss.

- **Vehicle Safety Work** – Published reports and papers from 24 years at NHTSA, including predictive modeling, sample design, impact estimation, and risk quantification affecting millions of vehicles.

- **About & Contact** – Background, technical capabilities, and how to connect.
