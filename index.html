            </a><br>
            <small>A report on trends in vehicle safety recall completion rates and identifying risk factors associated with lower completion rates. (Recall completion rates indicate the share of recalled vehicles that have been repaired or otherwise remedied.) 
                I conducted the modeling and drafted sections IIIc, IIId, V, and VI. In addition to the Williams-adjusted fixed-effects logistic regression described in the report, I also built  
                decision trees and generalized linear models, using LASSO, stepwise selection, and multi-fold cross-validation. My champion model was implemented by NHTSA to identify low-performing recalls for follow-up.</small>

            </a><br>
            <small>A study of improvements to vehicle safety, using negative binomial, log-linear, logistic, generalized logistic, and cumulative logistic models.
                My study showed that improvements collectively prevented over 700,000 crashes in a single year, as well as preventing or mitigating over one million injuries.

            </a><br>
            <small>In this series of posts, I explore advanced machine learning techniques in fraud detection, focusing on business objectives, visualizations, model deployments, and the underlying math.
                I investigate optimizing investigative resources supplementing hourly model runs targeting a given precision and recall. I also build two deployments with a tuned XGBoost model: a Databricks interactive dashboard for monitoring 
                fraud analytics and a Streamlit-based fraud detection API on Hugging Face Spaces.

            </a><br>
            <small>
                This paper presents and proves an algorithm that finds optimal sample sizes meeting nested univariate constraints of the coefficients of variation of a Horvitz-Thompson estimator under stratified simple random sampling.

            </a><br>
            <small>
                This paper, which was presented at the 2003 Enhanced Safety of Vehicle International Conference, describes changes to the calculations of the lives saved by safety belts and air bags. 
                It also discusses alternative methods for attributing a life saved to the safety belt or the air bag, for occupants protected by both devices.

            </a><br>
            <small>
                I conducted the analysis in Chapter 8 of this report, which calculates the recommended numbers of investigations, crash reports, and data collection sites to use for NHTSA's two premier crash databases (now called the Crash Report Sampling System and 
                Crash Investigation Sampling System). This chapter, which I drafted, also presents the analyses that could be conducted and conclusions that could be reached by the recommended sample sizes.

            </a><br>
            <small>
                I cowrote this report with a NHTSA engineer, which analyzes the relationship between occupant compartment deformation and injury to the occupant.
