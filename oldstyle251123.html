            <small>Your machine learning models are predicting fraud really well. 
              But are they giving you the full picture? Are they giving you the critical clues you need to understand today's fraud threat?
              In this project, I give an example where they don't and show how to use statistical anomaly detection to fill in the gaps.

            <small>You have uncovered a new way that criminals are committing fraud, with 3 unrelated cases out of 1,000 transactions. How pervasive could this new fraud type be?

              In this project, I show how much "AI/Stats 101" can lead you astray, and how to get the right answers with proper stats.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            I am a data analyst deeply grounded in mathematics and statistics, with extensive expertise uncovering insights and quantifying uncertainty. 
            My rigorous analytical approach enables me to tailor solutions that meet specific objectives while accommodating the challenges of messy and imperfect data.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked for many years analyzing vehicle safety data, and now want to carry over these skills to detecting fraud. 
            Most of the skills I applied to vehicle safety transfer directly to fraud detection. These include analyzing imbalanced (or rare event) data, 
            quantifying uncertainty, anomaly detection, data wrangling, and building interpretable models. To these, I have added other skills that are particularly useful 
            for fraud detection, like beefing up on Python, advanced machine learning models, data engineering, and imbalanced learning. This portfolio showcases all of them. 
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong foundation in math and statistics that allows me to rigorously analyze data and adapt advanced methods to complex challenges.</li>
        <li>Passionate about learning new tools and techniques in data science, with a focus on applying theoretical understanding to practical problems.</li>
        <li>Collaborative by nature, I enjoy working across disciplines to develop innovative solutions.</li>
        <li>Experienced in quantifying prediction uncertainty and other statistical rigor that enhances data-driven decision-making.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Technical Interests & Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing skills in data science techniques including supervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and imbalanced learning.</li>
        <li>Practical exposure to data wrangling and transformation using PySpark and SQL.</li>
        <li>Exploring experiment tracking and model management with MLflow.</li>
        <li>Building interactive dashboards and visualizations using Databricks.</li>
        <li>Committed to expanding my portfolio with projects illustrating both statistical theory and applied data science.</li>

            </a><br>
            <small>A report on trends in vehicle safety recall completion rates and identifying risk factors associated with lower completion rates. (Recall completion rates indicate the share of recalled vehicles that have been repaired or otherwise remedied.) 
                I conducted the modeling and drafted sections IIIc, IIId, V, and VI. In addition to the Williams-adjusted fixed-effects logistic regression described in the report, I also built  
                decision trees and generalized linear models, using LASSO, stepwise selection, and multi-fold cross-validation. My champion model was implemented by NHTSA to identify low-performing recalls for follow-up.</small>

                My study showed that improvements collectively prevented over 700,000 crashes in a single year, as well as preventing or mitigating over one million injuries.

            <small>
                This paper, which was presented at the 2003 Enhanced Safety of Vehicle International Conference, describes changes to the calculations of the lives saved by safety belts and air bags. 
                It also discusses alternative methods for attributing a life saved to the safety belt or the air bag, for occupants protected by both devices.

                I conducted the analysis in Chapter 8 of this report, which calculates the recommended numbers of investigations, crash reports, and data collection sites to use for NHTSA's two premier crash databases (now called the Crash Report Sampling System and 
                Crash Investigation Sampling System). This chapter, which I drafted, also presents the analyses that could be conducted and conclusions that could be reached by the recommended sample sizes.
